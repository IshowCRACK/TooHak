Iteration 1:

1. Assume user does not input Emoji's or any other unidentifiable characters that has not been specified in the specs in the inputs

2. Assume the structure of a valid email is of form 'string@string.domain', and can be accurately validated by the imported isEmail function from 'validator' package

3. According to itr 1 a strong password is a string that is considered to be more then 8 characters in length and consists at least 1 number and 1 letter. Thus assume if the string contains symbols or anything else that that is not a letter or number, the password is not valid even if the length is greater then 8.

4. Assume once the user has registered they will automatically login, thus there is no need to test for adminAuthLogin in the testing files for auth Register.
